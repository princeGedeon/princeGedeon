#### Machine Learning Ingineer,Developper Python,FullStack Django and React JS

I have been passionate about computer Science in general, for many years. The fact
to create applications, to configure systems, to control
remote machines are are all things that pushed me into this
domain.

I am amazed by Artificial Intelligence, the creation of neural networks with Deep Learning to solve difficult problems that escape classical programming.
My future career and my professional goal is to become a Machine Learning Engineer
